# Buzzword Bingo in Elm

## Project Structure

This is an incomplete project used as a starting point.

All of the Elm code lives in `Bingo.elm` and `BingoUtils.elm`.

This project is designed for version 0.16 of the Elm Platform and relies on the [elm-html](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/elm-html/4.0.2/) and [start-app](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/evancz/start-app/2.0.2/) packages. 

The `index.html` file embeds the program as a fullscreen app and includes
the necessary JavaScript (`bingo.js`) and CSS stylesheet (`style.css`).

## Build Instructions

Run the following command from the root of this project:

```
elm make Bingo.elm --output bingo.js
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser!
